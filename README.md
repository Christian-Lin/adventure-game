Adventure Game Project for Python from Udacity's course

- Project Overview
In this project, you'll make a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. You can find an example in the workspace below. Try it out to get a feeling for how the game works!

In order to build a program like this, we should first completely understand what it does. Take a notepad out, and play the game multiple times. The game will present you some scenarios and ask you to make one of 2 choices, by entering 1 or 2. In your notepad, record what happens each time you make a certain choice.

- The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
